# A Brief Overview of Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions, more commonly known as regex are a sequence of characters that make up a specific pattern used to match with strings within a block of code. Programmers use regex to modify text based on the criteria provided in their expressions. Understanding regex is important for the development of your skills as a programmer as it can expand your knowledge base in areas of text processing, data validation and more!
